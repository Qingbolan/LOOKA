# LOOKA

### An AI-Native Fashion Creation & Commerce Platform

**LOOKA** is a consumer-facing fashion platform that productizes** ** **clothing design capability** .

It allows anyone to turn ideas into** ** **wearable, producible garments** , and completes the full loop from inspiration to production:
 **create → try on → share → order → group-buy → reuse** .

LOOKA sits at the intersection of** ** **AI generation, fashion creation, and social commerce** .

---

## Problem

Fashion today is fragmented:

* Inspiration lives on social platforms, but cannot be acted on
* Custom clothing is inaccessible, expensive, or unreliable
* AI fashion tools generate images, not real garments
* Consumers lack confidence in fit, production quality, and delivery

There is no unified system that connects:
 **imagination → design → try-on → production → commerce** .

---

## Solution

LOOKA turns** ** **fashion imagination into a producible product** .

Users can:

* Describe or capture a look they love
* Generate editable clothing designs
* Try them on virtually
* See exactly how the garment will be produced
* Order individually or via group-buy
* Share and remix designs socially

All within one platform.

## Core Product Modules

### 1. Creation (Text & Image to Garment Design)

* Natural language input
* Image input (photo capture or upload)
* Mixed input supported
* Structured constraints:
  * Budget
  * Fabric preference
  * Scenario (work, daily, sport, formal)
  * Fit concerns
  * Style intensity

Output is** ** **not a one-off image** , but an editable garment design with structured attributes.

---

### 2. Design Understanding

* Automatic interpretation of imported photos:
  * Style
  * Silhouette
  * Garment structure
* Differentiates:
  * Same item
  * Similar style
  * Style-inspired redesign
* Prevents direct brand copying while enabling creative transformation

---

### 3. Visualization & Try-On

* Virtual closet for managing owned and created garments
* 2D try-on (v1) using user photos
* Fit and size recommendation based on body data
* Side-by-side comparison:
  * Design render
  * Try-on result

Focus is on** ** **purchase confidence** , not visual novelty.

---

### 4. Transparent Commerce

Before checkout, users see a** ** **Production Preview** :

* Style sheets (front / back / details)
* Garment specifications (measurements, silhouette)
* Fabric details
* Production method:
  * Ready-made
  * Light customization
  * Group-buy production
* Estimated lead time and MOQ

This removes the “black box” between AI design and physical delivery.

---

### 5. Group-Buy & Supply Chain Integration

* Enables made-to-order clothing at consumer-friendly prices
* Aggregates demand to meet factory MOQs
* Converts community interest into production efficiency
* Bridges AI generation directly to factory-readable specs (Tech Pack Lite)

---

### 6. Social & Community Layer

* Designs are shareable and remixable
* Each design includes a reusable recipe:
  * Prompt
  * Parameters
  * References
  * Version history
* Community features:
  * Like
  * Save
  * Remix
  * Design challenges
* Creator monetization:
  * Design recipe sales
  * Capsule collections
  * Revenue share on physical sales

Design becomes a** ** **social asset** , not just content.

---

## Why Now

* AI image generation has matured, but production workflows have not
* Consumers increasingly seek uniqueness over mass-market sameness
* Social commerce has proven demand generation power, but lacks customization
* Small-batch manufacturing and fast turnaround factories are becoming viable

LOOKA connects these trends into a single system.

---

## Business Model

* Transaction commission on physical orders
* Premium subscription for advanced generation and try-on
* Revenue share on creator-designed collections
* B2B licensing of design-to-production pipelines (future)

---

## Differentiation

LOOKA is** ** **not** :

* A pure AI image generator
* A traditional fashion marketplace
* A customization add-on to e-commerce

LOOKA is a** ** **design-to-production platform** , built consumer-first.

The key differentiation is** ** **production readiness** :
every design can become a real garment.

---

## Product Status

* Core product architecture defined
* MVP scope focuses on:
  * Single category
  * 2D try-on
  * Group-buy production
* Actively building v1

---

## Vision (Short)

**LOOKA makes everyone a designer — not by creating fantasy, but by making fashion creation usable, social, and real.**
